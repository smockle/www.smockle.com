If podcasts can drive sufficient customer acquisition, Ben’s thesis doesn’t hold up—direct-to-consumer companies can successfully integrate retail and marketing acumen and thereby profit.</p><p>This is by no means certain. Google could launch a dynamic ad insertion product built with superior ad-targeting technology, and companies would still be beholden to it for customers. Alternately, there may be too few podcast listeners for a direct-to-consumer company to build a sufficient customer base. Either way, I am interested in how Ben’s thoughts regarding direct-to-consumer companies and podcast advertising.</p><p>Finally, I enjoyed the following excerpt—the Internet may giveth market access, but taketh away competitive advantage:</p><blockquote><p>…way back when the world wide web first started publishers looked at the Internet and only saw the potential of reaching new customers; they didn’t consider that because every other publisher in the world could now reach those exact same customers, the integration that drove their business — publishing and distribution in a unique geographic area — had disintegrated.</p></blockquote></section></article><script defer src=/assets/js/redirect.js></script><footer><div class=post-meta>© 2020 Clay Miller ~ Licensed under
