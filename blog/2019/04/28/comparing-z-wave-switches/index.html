All three support Z-Wave Plus, are rated for a 600W (incandescent) max load, can dim LEDs, and require a neutral wire for installation. Each switch has a unique sound and feel when pressed. Unlike a traditional light switch, the paddle returns to a neutral position when released.</p><p><img src=/blog/uploads/2019/b0ff65f74b.jpg alt="Z-Wave Plus Dimmers (Front)"></p><h3 id=ge-14294>GE 14294</h3><p>The <strong>GE 14294</strong> is sold through many online retailers and is available in Lowe’s stores. Jasco makes a complete lineup of Z-Wave Plus products with the GE brand, including a non-dimming switch, a switch with built-in motion sensor, a fan control, an in-wall outlet receptacle, and an outdoor plug.</p><p><img src=/blog/uploads/2019/a640533067.jpg alt="GE 14294"></p><p>The plastic paddle is a bright, shiny white (the box also contains an almond-colored paddle). A single small LED is positioned at the bottom-right. An air gap switch is located at the bottom-left. When pressed, the paddle does not recess flush with the faceplate, like a traditional switch. Instead, it depresses very slightly and emits a low click. Dimming is controlled by pressing-and-holding the paddle.</p><h3 id=leviton-dw6hd>Leviton DW6HD</h3><p>The <strong>Leviton DW6HD</strong> is sold through many online retailers and is available in Home Depot stores. Leviton has a more limited selection of Z-Wave Plus products—notably lacking a Z-Wave <em>Plus</em> fan control or in-wall outlet receptacle.</p><p><img src=/blog/uploads/2019/3025436ad6.jpg alt="Leviton DW6HD"></p><p>Compared to the GE 14294, the plastic paddle has a more matte finish and is a less bright white (the box also contains an almond-colored paddle). A vertical line of LEDs is hidden behind the plastic to the left. To the right sits a narrow rocker that controls dimming. (The paddle is reserved for on/off.) The paddle feels cheaper than the GE 14294. When pressed, the paddle recesses flush with the faceplate and also overextends, revealing the back of the paddle. It’s unstable, jiggling horizontally. It makes a higher-pitched click.</p><h3 id=homeseer-hs-wd100>HomeSeer HS-WD100+</h3><p>The <strong>HomeSeer HS-WD100+</strong>, its successor the HomeSeer HS WD-200+, a non-dimming switch and a fan control are available for purchase on the HomeSeer website and at other online retailers.</p><p><img src=/blog/uploads/2019/87179809ce.jpg alt="HomeSeer HS-WD100+"></p><p>The plastic paddle is a bright, shiny white, identical to the GE 14294. An air gap switch is located at the bottom-center. A visible line of LEDs is arrayed to the left of the paddle. When pressed, the paddle has the same motion and sound as the GE 14294. The build quality is similarly high.</p><p><img src=/blog/uploads/2019/e936e60230.jpg alt="Z-Wave Plus Dimmers (Back)"></p></section></article><footer><div class=post-meta>© 2020 Clay Miller ~ Licensed under
