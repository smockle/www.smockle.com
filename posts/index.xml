I immediately identified with its commingling of art and code, and its existence made Ruby feel organic and approachable in a way that Java or .NET—with their dry, glossy tomes—did not. Consequently, the first version of smockle.com was built on Rails.
Whither Rails JavaScript had neither comic foxes nor glossy books.</description></item><item><title>Ben Thompson on new middlemen</title><link>https://blog.smockle.com/2020/02/26/ben-thompson-on-new-middlemen/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 14:48:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.smockle.com/2020/02/26/ben-thompson-on-new-middlemen/</guid><description>Ben Thompson contends the Internet did not do away with middlemen. Instead, he argues, direct-to-consumer companies (e.g. Harry’s) pay Google and Facebook (the leaders in targeted advertising) for customer attention in the same way consumer goods companies have historically paid brick-and-mortar retailers for shelf space.
Ben neglects to mention an obvious counterpoint: direct-to-consumer companies—selling cloud services, undershirts, pillows, or mattresses—frequently advertise on podcasts, and neither Google nor Facebook control podcast advertising.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.smockle.com/2020/01/25/finally-finished-foucaults-pendulum/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 15:56:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.smockle.com/2020/01/25/finally-finished-foucaults-pendulum/</guid><description>‪Finally finished Foucault’s Pendulum!

I liked rock because of its emotional immediacy, but it didn’t have the sophistication I want. And then I loved classical music like Bach for the sophistication, but it didn’t have the emotional immediacy. And I said I need something that brings together both.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.smockle.com/2019/12/31/a-high-level-overview-of-new-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 10:28:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.smockle.com/2019/12/31/a-high-level-overview-of-new-development/</guid><description>A high-level overview of new developments in Greenville: gvltoday.6amcity.com/greenvill&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://blog.smockle.com/2019/11/21/2020-goal-take-the-gmat-exam/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2019 17:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://blog.smockle.com/2019/11/21/2020-goal-take-the-gmat-exam/</guid><description>2020 Goal: Take the GMAT exam.

All three support Z-Wave Plus, are rated for a 600W (incandescent) max load, can dim LEDs, and require a neutral wire for installation. Each switch has a unique sound and feel when pressed.
